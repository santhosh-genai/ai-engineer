Goals : New user story 

        - Find the related user stories
        - Find the related testcases (relationship : user stories --> testcases)
        - Generate new testcases 

Steps to implement

1) extract the zip
2) open the vscode and add the folder to your workspace
3) open the terminal --> npm install
4) open the .env and read the inputs and create mongo (based on that)
    4.1) create db (db_stories_tests) and collection (test_cases)
    4.2) create another collection (user_stories)
    4.3) create testcase vector index (vector_index_test_cases)
         // refer src/config/testcases-vector-index.json
         // wait until it becomes Ready state
    4.4) create testcase bm25 index (bm25_search)
         // refer src/config/testcases-bm25-index.json
         // wait until it becomes Ready state
    4.5) create user stories vector index (vector_index_user_story)
         // refer src/config/user-stories-vector-index.json
         // wait until it becomes Ready state

5) Update the .env with your credentials and details
    - mongo URI, mistral API and groq API
6) Ingestion Pipeline (6000+ docs)
    6.1 ) open the terminal and run the command :
          node .src/scripts/embeddings/create-embeddings-batch-mistral.js
    6.2 ) Look at the terminal for errors (if none - go to mongo)
    6.3 ) Look at the mongo db for the data insertion
    6.4 ) Wait until all ingestion is done
    6.5 ) Try using web app (when you have time // not needed // skip for now)
    6.6 ) Push stories to mongo
          node .src/scripts/embeddings/create-userstories-embeddings-batch-mistral.js
7) Start the server (web - client and backend - server)
    7.1) npm run dev
    7.2) look at the web app and confirm the vector, bm25 and hybrid
